## Description

This application is the Week 11 Friday independent assignment for Epicodus' full time Intro to Programming and C#/React course.  This application was made to show using the MVC file structure, Entity Framework, and MySQL database to make objects within objects with a one-to-many relationship.

This web application allows a user, the owner of the Salon, to manage her employees (stylists) and their clients.  This keeps a list of stylists that are currently working at the salon and a list of their clients within each stylist.  It also keeps some information on each of the parties involved like everyone's name.  The application allows the user to add stylists and clients onto the lists and edit or delete entries as needed.
